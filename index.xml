      <description>The main objective in ROB-IN is to develop the enabling technology towards intelligent assistive robotics, and not to develop a final robotic solution at high TRL. Thus, the partners are experts in science and technology development (CSIC, UPC), data management and analysis (DATISION) and in care assessment (SUARA). Obviously, this is only a fraction of the value chain required to develop effective assistive robots, but at this point we still need to develop and validate some key enabling technologies.</description>
